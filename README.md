# AIBNIDS
An AI-powered Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) designed to identify malicious network traffic, with a focus on DDoS attack detection using Machine Learning techniques.  This project uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on real-world network traffic data from the CIC-IDS2017 dataset to classify packets as BENIGN or ATTACK.
